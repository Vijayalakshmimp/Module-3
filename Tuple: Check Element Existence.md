# Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to check whether an element 'r' and element '5' exists within a tuple.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a tuple `z` with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the `in` operator to check if the string `'r'` exists within the tuple.
3. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `5` exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
z=tuple(input())

print("r" in z)

print("5" in z)

## Output

## Result
Thus the Python program to check whether an element 'r' and element '5' exists within a tuple is executed and verified successfully.
