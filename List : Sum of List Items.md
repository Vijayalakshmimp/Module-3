# List Operations in Python: Sum of List Items

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **sum of all elements** in a list.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a list of numbers.
2. Use Pythonâ€™s built-in `sum()` function to calculate the total.
3. Print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program

items=[153,147,124,102]

sum=0

for x in items:

    sum+=x

print(sum)

## Output
<img width="1179" height="254" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42df55b7-ee15-4ef4-ac24-de5b2103547b" />


## Result
Thus the Python program that calculates the **sum of all elements** in a list is executed and verified successfully.
